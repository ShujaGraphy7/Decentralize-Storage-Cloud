Q1. once user buy the box he will be the owner of that box
    currently ownership transfer is not available for that box
     
Q2. once user create the box every time new unique box will be createed for 
    the user who purchase the box. and any user can create whatever amount of
    boxes they want to create for them.

Q3. yes there is a storage limit. each package has its own price and storage. 
    for encryption as we only store CID in smartcontract with its size in KB and ite file type and we store data on 
    IPFS so it is not possible to perform encryption of data in smartcontract
    we have to encrypt the data in frontend and then store it to ipfs.


--- Our Current Flow ---

1.  User A will purchase the box with factory(subscription) contract.
    the transaction fee will be transfered to the subscription smart contract.
    
2.  a new box address will assign to the user A which has it own seperate storage.
    user A can manage his box with box contract.

3.  if user B request for box access owned by user A. then 
    user A or owner of Factory(subscription) contract will approve
    or denied the request. 

4.  owner of Factory(Subscription) also allow some users to manage access requests
    so now these users can also accept or denied the access requests of specific box

5.  Now if user A wants to purhcase the new box. he has to purchase it from subscription contract
    when purchased a new box with unique id will we assigned to the user A.

6.  when user add the file to the box first file will be encrypted then uploaded to the ipfs
    then responce will be stored in blockchain which inclues
    (url of file stored on ipfs, size of file stored on ipfs, file extension)

7.  then allowed users and box admin can see the files.
